# Employee-Summary

## Description

This is my eleventh project for UA's coding bootcamp. It is NodeJS application that generates an HTML page of team members based on user input.

## Installation

To install this project download the repository, navigate to the 'lib' folder. From the command line run 'npm install'.

## Usage

While in the 'lib' folder run 'node script.js' from the command line.

You will be prompted for the number of members of your team and then will fill out their details. Your HTML page will be 'team.html' in the 'output' folder.
